# 2-wave-subscription.yaml
# Author: Christopher Engleby
#
# This resource defines a Subscription for the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)
# Operator via Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM).
#
# A Subscription automatically installs and tracks updates for a specific
# Operator from a designated Operator catalog source.
#
# This configuration pulls the RHDH operator from the `redhat-operators` index
# (usually synced from registry.redhat.io) located in the `openshift-marketplace`.
# The `channel` specifies which version stream to track â€” in this case, `fast-1.2`.
#
# Setting `installPlanApproval: Automatic` means that version upgrades will
# happen without manual approval.
#
# The ArgoCD sync wave ensures this applies after the OperatorGroup
# and before any dependent custom resources.
